#About
I created doc.md cause all the jsdoc tools I found were too complex or doesn't do what I wanted. So I decided to create my own jsdoc tool. It creates markdown, this makes it possible to look at the documentation directly in Github. 

#Install
`npm install -g doc.md`

#Usage

doc.md $SRCFOLDER $DESTFOLDER
